# CO2_Emission_-Data24

###  üåç Overview
This project focuses on analyzing and modeling Carbon Dioxide (CO‚ÇÇ) emissions per capita across 212 countries, using a rich dataset of environmental, energy, health, and socio-economic indicators. The data, covering metrics from 2004 to 2014, provides a global perspective on how different factors contribute to a country's per-capita carbon emissions.
The project involves data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, and the development of machine learning models ‚Äî specifically using Random Forest Regression ‚Äî to accurately predict CO‚ÇÇ emissions. The ultimate goal is to derive insights that support sustainable development and informed environmental policymaking.

### üéØ Objective
Primary Goal:
To build a robust machine learning model that can accurately predict CO‚ÇÇ emissions per capita using environmental and socio-economic data from multiple countries.
Key Objectives:

* Analyze the relationship between energy use, pollution, infrastructure, and carbon emissions.

* Identify the most influential features contributing to CO‚ÇÇ emissions.

* Handle missing and inconsistent data through effective preprocessing.

* Evaluate and compare machine learning models, with a focus on Random Forest Regression.

* Test the model on unseen data to assess generalization and real-world applicability.

## Environmental and Socio-Economic Indicators (212 Countries)
This dataset comprises diverse environmental, energy, health, and socio-economic indicators from 212 countries, aimed at predicting Carbon Dioxide (CO‚ÇÇ) emissions per capita. The data includes numerical and categorical features related to energy usage, pollution levels, resource depletion, and infrastructure, primarily around the years 2004 to 2014.

## üßπ Data Quality

Missing Values:
Several features have missing values (e.g., water withdrawals, fossil fuel usage). Imputation strategies (mean/median or KNN) may be required.

## Data Types:
13 numerical (float64)
3 categorical (object) ‚Äî most converted to numerical during preprocessing

Categorical mortality columns were encoded numerically or imputed.

## üéØ Target Variable
Carbon dioxide emissions per capita (tonnes) 2011 is the output variable used for regression modeling.
